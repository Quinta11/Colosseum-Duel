# Colosseum Duel

Colosseum Duel is a command line game programmed with Java that I created as a final project for CS 225 at ERAU-DB. Two AI-controlled combatants take turns attacking each other, with the goal of reducing their enemyâ€™s health points (HP) to zero. A human player is able to create and customize their own combatant, which is then pit against several automatically generated enemy combatants in successive 1v1s.

For more information, please refer to the software design document (SDD) available in the code repository; a separate test case document is also provided.
